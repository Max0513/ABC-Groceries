### Context

This is a fictive analysis done during the Data Science Infinity Course, the client, a grocery retailer, ran a campaign to promote their new "Delivery Club" - an initiative that costs a customer $100 per year for membership, but offers free grocery deliveries rather than the normal cost of $10 per delivery.

For the campaign promoting the club, customers were put randomly into three groups - the first group received a low quality, low cost mailer, the second group received a high quality, high cost mailer, and the third group were a control group, receiving no mailer at all.

The client knows that customers who were contacted, signed up for the Delivery Club at a far higher rate than the control group, but now want to understand if there is a significant difference in signup rate between the cheap mailer and the expensive mailer. This will allow them to make more informed decisions in the future, with the overall aim of optimising campaign ROI!

## Predicting Customer Loyalty Using ML

### Context

Our client, a grocery retailer, hired a market research consultancy to append market level customer loyalty information to the database.  However, only around 50% of the client's customer base could be tagged, thus the other half did not have this information present.

The overall aim of this work is to accurately predict the *loyalty score* for those customers who could not be tagged, enabling our client a clear understanding of true customer loyalty, regardless of total spend volume - and allowing for more accurate and relevant customer tracking, targeting, and comms.

To achieve this, we looked to build out a predictive model that will find relationships between customer metrics and *loyalty score* for those customers who were tagged, and use this to predict the loyalty score metric for those who were not.
